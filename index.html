                    I'm an undergraduate student at <b>Rutgers University</b>, in New Brunswick, NJ. I'm pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science and graduating in May 2027, when I hope to begin my full-time career as a Software Engineer. My journey into computer science began with a passion for problem-solving and a deep appreciation for the constant innovation in the field. I'm constantly trying to broaden my skills and proficiency to keep up and contribute to the tech field. I've joined clubs and pursued online resources that focus on different aspects of Computer Science. I've joined clubs and pursued online resources that focus on different aspects of Computer Science, complementing and enhancing the skills gained through my coursework.

                    Other than my major, I am involved in some extracurricular activities. I'm a member of Women in Computer Science, as well as a Sponsorship Chair for the HackHers hackathon the club hosts. I am a member of IEEE in the machine learning and artificial intelligence branch and of CHAARG, a women's workout club.

                    Outside of my academic career, I love to read. I really enjoy fantasy books and making my book nooks. Some other hobbies are listening to music, going to concerts, and cycling.
